# C Assignment
 This is the assignmet of Structured Programming 

 The problem was: 

Introductory:

We have already seen that we can use the strcat() to concatenate two strings. And we have
already learned how to create user defined functions. Now you can make a function which
receives two strings as parameters and then concatenate two strings in such a way that
each string is divided into two strings, that means string1 and string2 both will have two
parts for each: first half and second half. And after that, the program will produce another
string for the output which results after the concatenation in the following formula:

Output String = First half of string1 + First half of string2 + Second half of string1 +Second half of string2

Write an algorithm and implement a program in C to read the data from a
file (called “test.txt”), transform the data according to the discussion in
“Introductory”, and afterwards, save in another file (called “final.txt”).
Following sentences must be written in “test.txt”:

You're Born an Original
Don't Die a Copy!

Following sentence will be saved in the file “final.txt”:

You're Born Don't Die an Original a Copy!

[N.B. Do not use strcat(), strlen() and strcpy() functions]
